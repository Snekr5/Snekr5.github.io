	<h2> By Lemon Demon </h2>

 <div class="div1">
<p> Today has a way of scarring your eyes
With negative light, but it's a disguise
I put on my shades and see through the lies
The convenient truth is </p></div><br>
<div class="div1">
  <p>Light is on the way, we'll be having a fun time
It's such a lovely day, we should pocket the sunshine
And never give it back, even if there's a heat wave
Or terrorist attack, it will just be a close shave</p></div> 
<br>
<div class="div1">
  <p>I know (I know)
That every bomb has a silver lining
I know (I know)
It won't be long until</p></div> 
<br>
<div class="div1">
  <p>Everything works out nice in the end
The sun will marry the moon
It'll be fine
Why don't we sit back, mellow again
And have a nice afternoon?
It'll be fine</p>
 </div>

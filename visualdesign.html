<h2>Artifact #1:Album cover redesign</h2>
	
<img src="artifacts/mcr.png" width="556" height="564" alt=""/>
<p>My chemical romance is one of my favorite bands and to redesign "The Black Parade" I first inverted the colors so the white is black and the black is white. Then with a brush I added some blood effects. I also added the swords around the skeleton and bam we're done. </p> 
		
<h1>Artifact #2:Potato heads</h1>	
	
<img src="artifacts/Screenshot 2023-02-28 at 8.37.29 AM.png" width="695" height="411" alt=""/>
	<p>I did a carrot and added some ears,eyes,hands,a mustache and feet. I also added a cowboy hat. Not so sure what my thought process was.</p>
	
	<h2>Artifact #3: Fantastic beast battles</h2>
	
<img src="artifacts/fantasticbeast.png" width="802" height="794" alt=""/>
	
	<p>The first beast has pheonix wings,three snakes and the second has a toucan beak,a giraffe neck and a tiger body. To be honest I think the gorilla would win. </p>
	
	<h2>Artifact #4: Mandalas</h2>

	<p>I would have chosen different colors now but it doesnt look bad!</p>
	
	<h2>Artifact #5: Popart</h2>

	<img src="artifacts/Screenshot 2023-03-06 at 8.29.27 AM.png" width="596" height="404" alt=""/>
	
	<p>This is popart but with me in it! I think I look great in these.</p>

	<h2>Artifact #6:On my block</h2>

	<img src="artifacts/Screenshot 2023-03-06 at 8.42.12 AM.png" width="600" height="606" alt=""/>
	
	<p>I love the shadows I think I forgot to finish the background though. The windows are a bit wonky but it still looks alright.&nbsp;</p>

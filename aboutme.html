<h1>About me</h1>
<br>
<body>
<p>My name is Snek and I currently am in 10th grade!!! I'm 16 and I am going to get a summer job with syep. I have 4 sisters and a dog named Zorro. My mom and stepdad are really cool. I have a lot of interests and according to my sisters I'm obsessed with these. First one is Pokemon I love Pokemon and even though I never really played the games I always am super focused on collecting the trading cards. I donâ€™t know how to play it but that won't stop me from collecting them. There's currently 1,005 different pokemon excluding the regional forms,gigantamax and dynamax. I also love Splatoon it's my favorite game at the moment!!It's so addicting from the story mode to online it's really fun. One mode I like is salmon run! You have to defeat these bosses who are pretty gross looking since they are fish. Everyone is some sort of sea creature, there are crabs,squids,octopuses,lobsters,jellyfish and many more. I also love object shows such as inanimate insanity,hfjONE,Bfdi,EEE, and the nightly manor.&nbsp; I also like watching anime like, K-on,the disasterous life of saiki k,Kekkai sensen, maid sam, tokyo revenges and many more. Music is a huge inspration for me I'd like to have my own drumming kit and play the drums one day.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
